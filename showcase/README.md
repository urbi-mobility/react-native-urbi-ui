## react-native-urbi-ui showcase app

An app that showcases components and molecules from `react-native-urbi-ui`.

Launch it in your emulator / on your device by running:

    # from the top-level folder of the react-native-urbi-ui repo
    cd showcase
    yarn install

    # if you're not interested in iOS, skip the next 2 steps
    cd ios
    pod install

    # finally, launch the metro server, and the app
    yarn start
    yarn android # or yarn ios

You can also run `yarn android` / `yarn ios` from the top-level folder of `react-native-urbi-ui`.

In the examples, we're using `yarn`, but you can replace it with `npm` if that's what you're using.
